# ClinicPilot – Mini EHR Demo

This is a web-based, demo-ready Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for clinics, doctors, and health informatics learners. Built as part of my professional portfolio at CyberHealth Solutions, ClinicPilot showcases a real-world, modern EHR experience—fully interactive, with no backend or paid services required.
